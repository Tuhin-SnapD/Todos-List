# Todos-List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a web-application called the Todos-List.
What is it, you may ask? It's a list of tasks made by you, Tasks(Todos) you need to complete or things that you want to do. You can use this to do list in your home and personal life, or in the workplace. Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn't forget anything important.

Just type in the project directory to get started:
`yarn install`
`yarn start`
