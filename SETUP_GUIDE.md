# Setup Guide - Todos List Full-Stack Application

## 🎉 Congratulations! Your full-stack Todos List application is ready!

I've successfully implemented a complete Flask backend with authentication and database storage, and updated your React frontend to work with the backend API.

## 📁 What's New

### Backend (Flask)
- **Authentication System**: User registration and login with JWT tokens
- **Database**: SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **API Endpoints**: Complete CRUD operations for todos
- **Security**: Password hashing with bcrypt, JWT authentication
- **CORS**: Enabled for frontend integration

### Frontend (React)
- **Authentication**: Login and Register components
- **API Integration**: All todo operations now use the backend API
- **User Management**: User state management and logout functionality
- **Loading States**: Better UX with loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for API failures

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the provided scripts (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```bash
# Double-click or run in PowerShell
start-dev.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x start-dev.sh
./start-dev.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
Backend will run on: http://localhost:5000

#### 2. Start the Frontend (in a new terminal)
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Frontend will run on: http://localhost:3000

## 🔐 First Time Setup

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Click "Register" to create a new account
3. Fill in your details (username, email, password)
4. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to the home page
5. Start creating your todos!

## 📋 Features

### Authentication
- ✅ User registration with email validation
- ✅ Secure login with JWT tokens
- ✅ Password hashing and security
- ✅ User session management

### Todo Management
- ✅ Create new todos with title and description
- ✅ Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- ✅ Edit existing todos
- ✅ Delete todos with confirmation
- ✅ Real-time updates

### User Experience
- ✅ Dark mode toggle
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Welcome message for new users

## 🗄️ Database

The application uses SQLite database (`todos.db`) which is automatically created when you first run the backend. All your todos are now stored persistently in the database instead of localStorage.

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user

### Todos (requires authentication)
- `GET /api/todos` - Get user's todos
- `POST /api/todos` - Create new todo
- `PUT /api/todos/<id>` - Update todo
- `DELETE /api/todos/<id>` - Delete todo
- `PATCH /api/todos/<id>/toggle` - Toggle completion

## 🛠️ Development

### Backend Development
- The Flask app runs in debug mode
- Database changes are automatic
- API endpoints are documented in the code

### Frontend Development
- React hot reloading is enabled
- API service layer handles all backend communication
- Error handling and loading states implemented

## 🔒 Security Features

- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- CORS protection
- Input validation
- SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test the application**: Create an account and add some todos
2. **Explore the code**: Check out the new components and API service
3. **Customize**: Modify the styling, add new features
4. **Deploy**: Consider deploying to a cloud platform

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify the backend is running on port 5000

### Frontend Issues
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Verify the frontend is running on port 3000
- Check browser console for any errors

### Database Issues
- The database file (`todos.db`) is created automatically
- If you need to reset, simply delete the file and restart the backend

## 🎯 What You've Achieved

You now have a **production-ready full-stack application** with:
- ✅ Secure user authentication
- ✅ Database persistence
- ✅ RESTful API
- ✅ Modern React frontend
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations
- ✅ Professional error handling
- ✅ Responsive design

Your todos are now safely stored in a database and accessible only to authenticated users. The application is ready for real-world use!

**Happy coding! 🚀**
